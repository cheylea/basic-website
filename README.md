Page 1: Will be landing webpage of your website with appropriate name and links to other pages. Add a section on the right side of page showing images/scenes relevant to your selected topic (e.g., visiting places, football teams etc.,). You are allowed to include some text, if you wish.

Page 2: Must contain at least a textual, video and audio description of your selected topic. For example, a short ‘History’ or ‘Explanation’ in a paragraph along with a video and audio clips about your selected topic. Video/audio should not exceed more than 1 minute. There should be a link to next/previous page and some additional links for external websites (e.g., visiting places in that city etc.).
